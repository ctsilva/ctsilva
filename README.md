### Hey there! 👋

I'm Claudio Silva, Institute Professor of Computer Science and Data Science at New York University, where I direct the [Visualization Imaging and Data Analysis (VIDA) Center](http://vida.engineering.nyu.edu). I'm an ACM Fellow, IEEE Fellow, and recipient of the IEEE Visualization Technical Achievement Award. I also received a 2018 Technology & Engineering Emmy Award for my work on MLB's Statcast player tracking system.

My research spans visualization, visual analytics, machine learning, urban computing, and reproducibility. I enjoy building open-source tools that help others advance their research and solve real-world problems. Some projects that I've worked on include:

- [VisTrailsJL](https://github.com/ctsilva/VisTrailsJL), (WIP) a modern Julia reimplementation of VisTrails for scientific workflow and provenance management.
- 🚕 [TaxiVis](https://github.com/ctsilva/TaxiVis), a visual analytics application for exploring NYC taxi trip data using Qt5 and OpenGL.
- [afront](https://github.com/ctsilva/afront), an advancing front triangulation algorithm for high-quality adaptive surface meshing and remeshing.
- [ltfs-tools](https://github.com/ctsilva/ltfs-tools), tools for working with Linear Tape File System (LTFS) formatted LTO tapes (Linux and MacOS).
- [OpenSpace](https://github.com/OpenSpace/OpenSpace), open-source interactive visualization software for space exploration, deployed in 17+ planetariums worldwide. A collaboration with AMNH, Linköping University (Sweden), University of Utah, and others.
